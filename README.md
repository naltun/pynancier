# Pynancier
## A Python-implemented [Financier](https://github.com/naltun/financier) clone.

Pynancier is a Python-implemented clone of my other script, [Financier](github.com/naltun/financier), which is written in PHP.

### Why
Because I check [CoinMarketCap](coinmarketcap.com) daily, and frequently, but I hate leaving the terminal unnecessarily. As a result, I developed Financier, and Pynancier, so that I can keep this script handy in the terminal and not have to leave (drive-by-keyboard ftw).

### TODO
I'm needing to add some more functionality to this script, as well as improve the documentation. Currently, I have comments in the code _loosely_ walking people through what's going on. It's a small script, to be honest. The documentation will most likely exist within the README and will simply explain some of the arguments which can be supplied to the script. Namely, you can specify an integer argument which displays the top `N' performing cryptocurrencies and accompanying information.

Preferably, I can add curses to the script so that the user can specify any number of currencies they want and scroll through them accordingly. If that's the case, then I can get rid of the `clear' function altogether. Things for the future. The most immediately planned feature is to specify a maximum of ~6 as the command-line argument for the script, so that all information can be displayed equally.

### DISCLAIMER
I'm not a Python hacker. Heck, I'm not even a _Pythonista_. I took this project on (and will probably make this my _main_ script for cryptocurrency) as a result of taking on the task of learning Python at work. Want to learn a new language? _Build_ something. Hence, _Pynancier_.

If anyone has any Pythonic feedback, I'd very much appreciate any. :) I'd be sure to give that expertise back to the community.
